### React Player Voting App

This is a small example React application where users can vote for their favourite player. It is served via live-server. This is part of my [Full Stack React study](https://www.fullstackreact.com/).
 
### Demo
Checkout the [Codepen example](https://codepen.io/jamesg1/pen/aqWvvr).

### Usage

1. Ensure you have `npm` installed.

Follow the instructions for your platform [here](https://github.com/npm/npm).

2. Install `http-server`

````
npm install
````

3. Boot the HTTP server

````
npm run server
````

The server is now running at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)
